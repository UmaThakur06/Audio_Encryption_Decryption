# Audio_Encryption_Decryption
Audion Encryption and Decryption  using RSA algorithm
The proposed methodology consists of two stages: encryption and decryption of the audio signal using RSA algorithm. 
Public and private keys are generated previously and then the public key is used to encrypt the acquired speech or audio samples at the transmitter. 
The ciphered or encrypted audio samples are generated and then decrypted sample by employing the private key
